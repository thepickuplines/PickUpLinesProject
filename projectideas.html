										<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
										<p>The project that we will be making involves making a website that allows users to submit and rate pick-up lines submitted by other users, whether they are “good” or “bad” and what category of pick-up lines (e.g. sport, music, etc.). It will involve a database where user submissions and ratings for those submissions are stored with the appropriate category. Users should also be able to see the statistics for pick-up lines and also featured statistics that show the most popular lines in a data visualisation. The project shall be titled, "Rate My Pick-Up Line".</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Description</h3>
												<p>“Rate My Pick-Up Line” is based on user-generated content (UGC); allowing users to create their pick-up line submissions to the website. Users can post anonymously or use an account to see their submissions (including statistics) and save pick-up lines made by other users.</p>
												<p>When the user visits the website, the prominent feature that will be presented is a pick-up line on the screen, with a “good” button to indicate that the pick-up line was effective/humourous, or “bad” if the pick-up line is not satisfactory. Once the user has made a rating, they can see the statistics for that particular pick-up line, including the dominant percentage (e.g. this pick-up line has a 67% “good” rating). The user should then have the option to continue going through more pick-up lines or be prompted to suggest their own. Users should also be able to comment on pick-up lines and converse with other users for interaction with their rating shown once they have placed a rating for it.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Motivation</h3>
												<p>In a similar vein to <a href="https://either.io">'either.io'</a> (Would You Rather), “Rate My Pick-Up Line” attempts to use a similar rating system and the idea of rating pick-up lines has not been thought up yet in a website concept, thus making a website with a database server that can give users suggestions for what pick-up lines they should use or suggest their own and see how ‘good’ it is. This is also a website that does not take pick-up lines too seriously like ‘Would You Rather’, therefore, this project also aims to entertain users and see what other users come up with, “good” or “bad”.</p>

												<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
												<p>The tools and technologies required may include, but are not limited to:</p>
												<li>JavaScript</li>
												<li>HTML</li>
												<li>SQL Server</li>
												<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
												<p></p>
												<p>With the use of these technologies and tools, we will be able to shape the aesthetic of the website and make sure that data being inputted by users is stored in a SQL Server through JavaScript on the website.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Skills Required</h3>
												<p>The skills that will be required for this project are:</p>
												<li>Knowledge of SQL</li>
												<li>UX Design</li>
												<li>Basic HTML Knowledge</li>
												<li>JavaScript Knowledge</li>
												<li>Basic Multi-Media editing skills (photo editing)</li>
												<p></p>
												<p>As the scope of this project should be small, finding the skills required may be easy to do, especially that some of these skills are currently being taught at RMIT.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Outcome</h3>
												<p>If the project becomes successful, then “Rate My Pick-Up Line” should be able to take plenty of user submissions and provide interesting pick-up lines, as well as entertainment for other users looking to interact with the website. The original problem will have been solved by the curation of pick-up lines that the website provides to users that can be rated and then viewed, whether it was “good” or “bad”. The impact of this development is that it will help develop the skills to create a link between a website and a SQL server that is able to serve statistics to the user, as well as provide a proper UX and registration services.</p>
